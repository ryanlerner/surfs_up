# Surf's Up Analysis

## Overview

  This analysis was intended to provide W. Avy with weather knowledge when considering opening a surf/ice cream store. Since surfing and eating ice cream are activities that rely on having warm weather conditions, the temperature statistics matter when considering whether to open this store. Since June and December represent the beginning months of summer and winter, our analysis specifically focused on the summary statistics for these 2 months betweeen 2010 and 2017.
